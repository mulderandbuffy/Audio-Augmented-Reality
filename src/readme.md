# Readme

Put a brief description of your code here. This should at least describe the file structure.

## Build instructions

**You must** include the instructions necessary to build and deploy this project successfully. If appropriate, also include 
instructions to run automated tests. 

### Requirements

List the all of the pre-requisites software required to set up your project (e.g. compilers, packages, libraries, OS, hardware)


* Requires Bose Frames or Bose NC700 Headset
* Unity version `2021.3.11f1`
* Android Phone (Tested on OnePlus 8T running Android 12 (API 31))
### Build steps

List the steps required to build software. 

Hopefully something simple like `pip install -e .` or `make` or `cd build; cmake ..`. In
some cases you may have much more involved setup required.

### Test steps

List steps needed to show your software works. This might be running a test suite, or just starting the program; but something that could be used to verify your code is working correctly.

Examples:

* Run automated tests by running `pytest`
* Start the software by running `bin/editor.exe` and opening the file `examples/example_01.bin`
