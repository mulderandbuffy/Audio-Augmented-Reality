## How To Use
On startup, the connected Bose device can be connected to the app via the provided GUI. There will be both an audio and graphical confirmation when the headset has successfully connected to the app.

(If wearing the headset) Look up and you should hear a confirmatory sound effect, followed by a 3D weather effect. The effect should continue for as long as you look up.

There are three example datasets which use the current time to pull a weather effect. These can be freely switched between using the `Set 1`, `Set 2` and `Set 3` buttons.

The `Demo` button toggles a demo mode where any of the available sounds can be enabled.

By **firmly** double tapping the right arm of the Frames or tapping and holding the touch panel on the right earcup of the NC700 headphones you can enter Forecast Mode. Sounds will appear in a ring around your head - in front of you is the current weather and these sounds then progress in one hour increments.

It is beneficial to try and pick out one sound, and then try to follow it as you move your head.

## Customise
The `Menu` button opens a settings menu that allows you to customise aspects of the experience.

By turning up `Gesture Sensitivity` we lower the height at which the look up gesture triggers.

By turning up `Effect Off Delay` we increase the distance the head can travel back down before turning the effect off.

By switching between the different settings of `Forecast Mode` we can adjust how may hours of weather are included in the Forecast view.

## Troubleshooting

It is best (when running the app from Android and using Bluetooth to connect to the headset) to power on and connect to the device before opening the app. Try to keep the headset as level as possible when powering it on.

If the sound activates when looking down instead of up, rotate the headset **360 degrees once**. This can often fix the issue.

If all else fails, close the app, power off and reconnect the headset.
