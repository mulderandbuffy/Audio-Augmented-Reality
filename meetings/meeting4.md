# Meeting 4 27/10/2022

## Completed This Week
* The spare frames do not work
* Started Unity project for weather app
* Created particle systems for rain and snow to which sound scripts will be affixed
* Picked up the headphones

## Questions
* Code attribution i.e. from tutorial videos or template files on github
* Using git with Unity
* Good free sound libraries or does the uni have access to any
* Attribution for sounds/other assets - where and how should they be cited and should I be tracking where I get these from

## To do
* Particle system sound script
* Set up effects and sounds for weather not using particle systems
* Set up with headphones
