Meeting 2 - 13/10/2022

Have mostly been reading since last meeting.

Diego is apparently open to being emailed - will get that done
Weather idea is a good start and a good base to build on later

Reading is good! Keep reading
Mark McGill has some QC35IIs that can also be used - email him for more information
