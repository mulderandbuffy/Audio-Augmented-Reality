Questions for First Meeting:

Do you know of anywhere I can find API docs online since they all seem to have been taken down? - Have been sent the required unity package
Since the project uses nonstandard hardware, how far in advance should I be thinking about experiments and seeking ethical approval? - It's not nonstandard as it's commercially available

If I run ideas past people (i.e. flatmates) or test out features on them are they then no longer able to participate in an experiment?
Do I need a specific version of unity or is the free/student plan enough? - Free should be enough (Now downloaded and configured)

Notes from First Meeting:

Last year's student made an audio menu
How do we add to reality with sound?
We want to ADD to reality rather than overlay something wildly out of place
Weather integration?
The Bose frames have basic position sensors on board, but there is an external sensor unit available for use

Will be put in contact with students who have worked/are working in similar areas
Group meetings with other supervisees from now on.
