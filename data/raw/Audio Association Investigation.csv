"2023/01/29 3:12:46 PM GMT","Yes","Rain","5","","Wind","3","The sound of the wind chimes is a bit too overpowering when compared to the sound of the wind. It might be difficult to tell whether this is meant to be a weather sound or a ringtone. Perhaps it would be better to have a louder wind sound with the occassional wind chimes.","Thunderstorm with rain","4","Perhaps the thunder could be louder in some parts.","Strong wind/Blizzard","4","I can hear the wind clearly, but I'm not sure what the other noise is in the audio. It sounds a bit like wind chimes, but it's not obvious. I would say the additional noise is a bit distracting.","Sunny","4","There is a bit of background noise in addition to the birds singing. It would be good if this noise could be isolated, because it might seem to the user that there is a slight wind as well.","Cloudy/cloudy fall day","3","There is some slight music playing near the end of the audio, which reminds me of ""relaxing"" music. I think it would be good to remove this music because it doesn't seem like it has much to do with communicating the weather.","Heavy rain","5","It is clear that the sound is of heavy rain, but the crackling noise seems to have little to do with rain. It sounds a bit like a fireplace.","Snowy","4","I think the sound could be improved by slightly reducing the bell sounds. Bells can be associated with Christmas, and therefore snow, but users who may not celebrate Christmas  might not make that association."
